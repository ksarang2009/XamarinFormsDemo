# XamarinFormsDemo
Sample addition program test demo. 

## Project Details
This repository has four projects in one solution `XamarinFormsDemo.sln`
* XamarinFormsDemo (Portable)
* XamarinFormsDemo.Android
* XamarinFormsDemo.iOS
* XamarinFormsUITest

### Addition Logic Implementation
The UI for task which takes two numbers and adds them without using +, -, * or / operator is in [MainPage.xaml](https://github.com/ksarang2009/XamarinFormsDemo/blob/master/XamarinFormsDemo/XamarinFormsDemo/XamarinFormsDemo/MainPage.xaml) and code behind it is in [MainPage.xaml.cs](https://github.com/ksarang2009/XamarinFormsDemo/blob/master/XamarinFormsDemo/XamarinFormsDemo/XamarinFormsDemo/MainPage.xaml.cs) file.

### Building apk file
For preparing an apk for the android project following task for building the application for release, which mainly entails setting some application attributes.
  * Specify the Application Icon
  * Version the Application
  * Shrink the APK
  * Compile
  * Archive for Publishing
  
To achieve all the above for this project, here is a step by step guide
* In `Solution Explorer` right click on `XamarinFormsDemo.Android` project > click `Properties` > `Application Manifest`.
* Add `Application name` as XamarinFormsDemo
* Add XamarinFormsDemo.Android in `Package name`
* From the dropdown control select `Application icon`
* Add 1 as `Version number` & 1.0 as `Version name`
* To Shrink the APK size a combination of the Xamarin.Android linker, which removes unnecessary managed code, and the ProGuard tool from the Android SDK, which removes unused Java bytecode are used. The build process first uses the Xamarin.Android linker to optimize the app at the managed code (C#) level, and then it later uses ProGuard (if enabled) to optimize the APK at the Java bytecode level.
  * Click `Android Options` tab
  * Select `SDK Assemblies Only` from the `Linking` dropdown â€“ This will only link the assemblies that are required by Xamarin.Android. Other assemblies will not be linked.
  * Check the `ProGuard` option. Proguard is an Android SDK tool that links and obfuscates Java code. ProGuard is normally used to create smaller applications by reducing the footprint of large included libraries (such as Google Play Services) in your APK. ProGuard removes unused Java bytecode, which makes the resulting app smaller.
* To target Android app to just armeabi-v7a(or the precise ABI on the device the is being run on) - click `Android Options` tab > scroll to bottom > click `Advance` button & choose from `Supported Architechtures`.
* Check `Generate One Package (.APK) per Selected ABI` by this one APK will be created for each of the supported ABI's (one apk for this case)
* To protect the application & disable debugging select `Release` mode
* After all of the above steps are completed, the app is ready for compilation. Select `Build` > `Rebuild Solution` to verify that it builds successfully in Release mode.
* To begin the publishing process, right-click the project in `Solution Explorer` and select the `Archive` context menu item.

`Archive` launches the `Archive Manager` and begins the process of archiving the App bundle & generates apk file in `bin` > `Realease` folder.

### Building ipa file
* iTunes Artwork Setup
  * Open `Solution Explorer` and expand `XamarinFormsDemo.iOS` project.
  * Double-click the `Info.plist` file to open it for editing.
  * Scroll to the iTunes Artwork section of the editor.
  * For any missing image, click on the thumbnail in the editor, select the image file for the desired iTunes artwork from the Open File dialog box and click the OK or Open button.
* Creating an IPA
  * Open `Solution Explorer`, right-click the XamarinFormsDemo.iOS project name and select Properties to open them for editing
  * Select iOS IPA Options and select Ad-Hoc from the Configuration dropdown list.
  * Specify package name for the IPA
  * Save your changes to the Project Properties.
  *  Select Ad Hoc from the Build Configuration dropdown.
  * Build the project to create the IPA package.
  * The IPA will be build in the bin > iOS Device > Ad Hoc folder.
 
`[Note]: I have follwed these steps but I don't have any mac machine connected, I didn't find the ipa file in bin > iOS Device > Ad Hoc folder. The VS warning I got was - warning : There is no available connection to the Mac, hence the task Xamarin.MacDev.Tasks.CollectBundleResources will not be executed.`
